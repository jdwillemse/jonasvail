As a first step in a concerted brand-building effort in Europe, the strategy was to celebrate some of the most interesting Twitch Creators from the UK, France, and Germany who go live on the platform, and help make it the weird, wonderful, and diverse community it is.\n\nThough starting relatively small—online, in social, and on outdoor spaces across London, Paris, Berlin, and beyond—the campaign was a sign of exciting things to come from Twitch in Europe.",

In April 2019 adidas announced the development of a new, 100% recyclable, all-TPU performance running shoe called \\[FUTURECRAFT\\] Loop. The idea is that you wear it out, send it back, and the shoes are ground up and the material is reused to help make the next generation of Loop shoes – and the process continues. The shoe itself was \"made to be remade\". It was part of adidas’ larger vision to stop the use of virgin polyesters in their products by 2024 and to enable a “closed loop” or circular manufacturing model. I worked with them to develop a creative strategy and campaign centered around the idea that the future is on all of us, and that with \\[FUTURECRAFT\\] Loop, adidas and its consumers could work together to end plastic waste.",

While any past brand baggage doesn’t go away, a new console launch provides an opportunity for a total reconsideration of the brand – one that will set the course for the next six or seven years of that console’s life cycle. If you don’t get it right you risk losing that generation’s console war.\n\nGoing into the 2013 launch of PS4, PlayStation was feeling the heat from all sides. Despite new gaming competition from the likes of Apple and Android, the biggest battle would still come from arch-rival Xbox.  \n\nIt was a modern-day David vs. Goliath, with Microsoft outspending PlayStation across Europe and Australia by three to one. We couldn’t outspend them, so we had to outsmart them.  \n\nWhile Xbox One was giving gamers a back seat by positioning itself as a one-stop \"entertainment\" box, the strategy was to go back to PlayStation's roots as a brand by putting gamers and gaming at the very heart of everything PS4 stood for. In so doing, we rebranded those gamers in an own-able way that Xbox couldn’t – as \"Players\". \n\n“FOR THE PLAYERS” became a Euro Effie Grand Prix winning launch campaign, and drove market leadership in 50 markets versus XBox. \n\nThe “FOR THE PLAYERS” platform transcended the launch to become a business driving idea that guided every aspect of the PlayStation business for the six years that followed. The platform also led us to develop an entire brand ecosystem, complete with a brand book including brand purpose, mission, tone of voice, behaviors, and Player segmentation. \n",
